# **3W – Full Stack Internship Assignment**

### **Task 1: Build a Mini Social Post Application**

**Objective:**  
 Create a simple social post feature where users can create accounts, post text or images, view posts from others, like, and comment — similar to the **Social Page** in the TaskPlanet app.

---

### **Step 1 – Explore the Reference App**

1. Download and open the **TaskPlanet App** from Play Store:  
    👉 [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.taskplanet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.taskplanet)

2. Go to the **Social Page** from the bottom navigation.

3. Take UI inspiration from that page and make your project look and feel similar.

---

### **Step 2 – Features to Build**

1. **Account Creation**

   * Simple **signup and login** with email and password.

   * Store user details in the database (MongoDB).

2. **Create Post**

   * A user can post **text**, **image**, or **both**.

   * Both fields should not be mandatory (either one is enough).

3. **Feed**

   * All posts from all users should be visible in a public feed.

   * Display username, post content, likes, and comments count.

4. **Like and Comment**

   * Other users should be able to like or comment on any post.

   * Show total likes and comments.

   * Save the usernames of people who liked or commented.

---

### **Step 3 – Tech Stack**

* **Frontend:** React.js

* **Backend:** Node.js \+ Express

* **Database:** MongoDB

* **Styling Options (Choose any one or mix):**

  * **Material UI (MUI)**

  * **React Bootstrap**

  * **Basic CSS**  
     ❌ *Do not use TailwindCSS.*

* *(Optional)* You can also make this project as a **mobile app** using **React Native CLI** instead of React.js.

---

### **Step 4 – Project Guidelines**

* Keep your UI **simple, clean, and inspired by the TaskPlanet social feed**.

* Use **only two MongoDB collections** — one for users and one for posts.

* Ensure basic authentication flow (signup → login → create post → view feed).

* Make sure like and comment updates reflect instantly in the UI.

---

### **Step 5 – Deliverables**

You must submit the following:

1. **GitHub Repository Link**

   * Public repository.

   * Separate folders for frontend and backend code.

2. **Deployment**

   * Host your project using:

     * **Frontend:** Vercel / Netlify

     * **Backend:** Render 

     * **Database:** MongoDB Atlas
